# Known Issues
- occasional issue with gold count after guards have taken gold making it impossible to complete level

# Rough plans
- Longer term: consider incorporating tilesets and concepts from LodeRunner Mad Monks Revenge
- Support for jumping to specific level
- Add game editor?  This would require kernal SAVE support from banked RAM

# TODO
- Code cleanup/reorg among files
- TBD: refactoring to enable unit testing of core functions that aren't graphics-related
