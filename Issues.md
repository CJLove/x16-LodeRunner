# Known Issues
- game playability
  - tuning of guard movement per tick
- occasionally able to dig the brick below a ladder
- occasionally able to run over a hole that is about to be filled
- Handle case of guard being too close to runner when digging

# Rough plans
- Longer term: consider incorporating tilesets and concepts from LodeRunner Mad Monks Revenge
- Figure out sound
- Add opening screen with world/level selection, support for jumping to specific level
- Add game over screen
- Add game editor?  This would require kernel SAVE support from banked RAM

# TODO
- Code cleanup/reorg among files
- TBD: refactoring to enable unit testing of core functions that aren't graphics-related
